📊 Project Title:

Exploratory Data Visualization on Global COVID-19 Impact


---

🎯 Objective:

To analyze and visualize the global impact of COVID-19 through interactive charts and graphs using Python, to identify trends, affected regions, and mortality rates across countries.


---

🛠️ Tools & Technologies:

Python (Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab)

Pandas & NumPy (Data Analysis)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Static Visualization)

Plotly & Dash (Interactive Dashboard)

Tableau or Power BI (Optional for professional visualization)



---

📂 Dataset:

Use COVID-19 dataset from Our World in Data
Alternative: Kaggle – COVID-19 Data Repository


---

🪜 Project Breakdown:

1. Data Collection

Load dataset (CSV from GitHub or Kaggle).

Understand columns like date, location, new_cases, total_deaths, population.


2. Data Cleaning

Handle missing values (fill/replace/drop).

Filter out relevant countries or focus on continents.

Convert data types if needed (dates, numbers).


3. Data Analysis

Calculate total cases, deaths, recovery rates.

Identify top 10 countries by:

Highest cases

Highest death rate

Highest vaccination rates (if available)



4. Visualizations

📈 Line Chart: Daily new cases (worldwide or per country)

📊 Bar Chart: Total cases by country

🌍 Choropleth Map: Global spread (Plotly)

📉 Pie Chart: Continent-wise case distribution

🟢 Animated Timeline (Plotly): Cases over time


5. Dashboard (Optional but impactful)

Use Plotly Dash or Power BI/Tableau to create:

Filters for country/continent

Date slider

Real-time stats (Total cases, deaths, vaccinations)
